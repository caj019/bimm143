The steps to "transport" your data from here onto git to be able to track changes are
1. Stage what you want to update
2. Commit
3. Push to Git

###Important Git Commands
I think you run these in either the console or terminal?
`git status`
- report on a content change
`git add <filename>`
- stage/track a file
`git commit -m "message"`
- snapshot
`git log`
- review your commit history
`git diff <commit.ID> <commit.ID>`
- Inspect content differences
`git checkout <commit.ID>`
- Navigate through the commit history
