##PDB statistics
Here we are going to inspect the types of structures in the main database for 3D biomolecular data - the PDB.
Q1: Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. Also can
you determine what proportion of structures are protein? 
```{r}
#read in file
stats <- read.csv('Data Export Summary.csv', row.names = 1)
stats
#calculate percentage values for each 'method'
ans <- stats$Total/sum(stats$Total) *100
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
round(ans, 2)
```
```{r}
round(sum(stats$Proteins)/sum(stats$Total) * 100, 2)
```
